# Target-Heart-Rate-Calculator
Homework 3
The objective of this homework is to give you experience using C++.
Target Heart-Rate Calculator
While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range
suggested by your trainers and doctors. According to the American Heart Association (AHA)
(www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4736) the formula for calculating your maximum
heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years. Your target heart rate is 50-85% of your
maximum heart rate. [Note: These formulas are estimates provided by the AHA. Maximum and target
hear rates may vary based on the health, fitness, and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician
or qualified health care professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.]
Create a class called HeartRates. The class attributes should include the person’s first name, last name,
and date of birth (consisting of separate attributes for the month, day, and year of birth). Your class
should have a constructor that receives this data as parameters. For each attribute, provide set and get
functions. The class should also include a function getAge that calculates and returns the person’s age
(in years), a function getMaximumHeartRate that calculates and returns the person’s maximum heart
rate, and a function getTargetHeartRate that calculates and returns the person’s target heart rate.
Function getAge should prompt the user to enter the current month, day, and year before calculating
the person’s age. Write an application (main) that prompts for the person’s information, instantiates an
of class HeartRates, and prints the information from that object, including the person’s first name, last
name, and date of birth, and then calculates and prints the person’s age in years, the maximum heart
rate, and the target heart rate.
Execute your test program and copy the output to a text file, which will demonstrate proper execution.
What to submit:
Please submit a copy of your source code files, a makefile, and a text file(s) that includes the execution
output that demonstrates proper operation.
